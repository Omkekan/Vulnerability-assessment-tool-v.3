# Vulnerability-assessment-tool-v.3
# AI-Enhanced Vulnerability Scanner

## Project Overview

This is an AI-Enhanced Vulnerability Scanner tool that integrates Nmap for network scanning and a machine learning model trained on vulnerability data (CVEs) to identify potential vulnerabilities. The tool provides both vulnerability scanning based on Nmap results and searches for vulnerabilities in services running on open ports. It also includes operating system detection if available and offers remediation recommendations for found vulnerabilities.

The scanner is designed to be user-friendly, with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. The results of the scan are displayed in the application window, and the tool uses custom search to look up any vulnerabilities for discovered services.

## Features

- **Nmap integration**: Scans open ports and detects services and versions.
- **AI-driven vulnerability prediction**: Uses a machine learning model trained on CVE data to predict vulnerabilities.
- **Custom search integration**: Uses a Google custom search engine to fetch vulnerability details for discovered services.
- **Operating system detection**: Retrieves OS information from the Nmap scan (if available).
- **Graphical User Interface**: Provides a simple Tkinter-based interface for easy use.
- **Remediation suggestions**: Offers recommendations for addressing identified vulnerabilities.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.7 or above
- `nmap` installed on your system (required for the Nmap scans)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Omkekan/Vulnerability-assessment-tool-v.3.git
    cd Vulnerability-assessment-tool-v.3
    ```

2. **Set up the virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
    # OR
    venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

    Install dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Download the necessary CSV file:**

    Place your CVE dataset (`cve.csv`) in the root directory of the project.
    I have added the file into the repo or you can download it from
    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewkronser/cve-common-vulnerabilities-and-exposures
    also you can use your own database to train this model

6. **Run the tool:**

    Once everything is installed, you can start the application by running the Python script:

    ```bash
    python Main.py
    ```

## How It Works

1. **Nmap Scanning**: 
   - The application uses Nmap to scan a target IP for open ports, services, and running versions. If operating system detection is available, it will be displayed.

2. **Vulnerability Prediction**:
   - The machine learning model, trained on CVE data, predicts potential vulnerabilities based on the Nmap scan results (services, versions, and protocols).

3. **Vulnerability Lookup**:
   - The application uses a Google Custom Search Engine (CSE) to search the web for vulnerabilities related to the detected services and versions.

4. **Results and Remediation**:
   - The scan results, including potential vulnerabilities and remediation suggestions, are displayed in the application's GUI.

## Usage

1. **Enter the target IP or hostname** in the field provided.
2. **Select the scan type** (e.g., Fast Scan, Service Version Scan) from the dropdown menu.
3. Click on **Start Scan** to begin the scanning process.
4. The results, including open ports, services, operating system (if detected), and potential vulnerabilities, will be displayed in the log area.

## Model Training

- The model is trained using the CVE dataset (`cve.csv`). The features used for training are:
  - `cvss`: Common Vulnerability Scoring System score.
  - `impact_total`: The total impact score calculated based on availability, confidentiality, and integrity impact.
  - `access_complexity`: The complexity required to exploit the vulnerability.
  - `access_vector`: The attack vector used to exploit the vulnerability.
- The target is the CWE code representing the type of vulnerability.

To retrain the model, run the relevant sections in `Main.py` that deal with loading and training the model, making sure the dataset is up to date.

## Dependencies

- `pandas`
- `nmap-python`
- `joblib`
- `requests`
- `scikit-learn`
- `reportlab`
- `tkinter`
